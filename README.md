Order of Inheritance
In this  in this question, you are given the code of a number of classes. For convenience, the body of the classes is empty. Each class inherits from a number of classes. It is necessary that the parent class is always defined before the child class.

Input
The input consists of a number of classes. Each class has two lines of code, separated by a blank line. The names of the defined classes are guaranteed to be distinct, and the number of classes is limited to a maximum of 10. Each class is in this format
class <name>[ extends <class_1>, <class_2>, ..., <class_n>]:

Output If there is an arrangement of classes that will run the program without problems, print possible and otherwise impossible
